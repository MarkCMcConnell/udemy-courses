Projects in the HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, and todo-projects require no further setup.

To run the rest of the projects, make sure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed. Then, run `npm install`.  This will bring you up to date with the required packages and version to successfully run the project.

Most of the back end/full stack apps can be started in your command line with `node app.js`.  Check the root directory or package.json of each project for any discrepancies in the entry point.

Another option is to install Nodemon with `npm install -g nodemon` and then run `nodemon` to start the app.
